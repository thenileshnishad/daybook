## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (any recent version with npm)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (either locally installed or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### 🧱 Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thenileshnishad/daybook.git

   cd daybook/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and set the variables accordingly:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/daybook
   JWT_SECRET=rushB@5678
   ```

   **The following is not necessary, if you are going to run it locally.**

   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

4. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

### 🖥️ Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the root directory (daybook, not backend):**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables (Not necessary, if you are going to run it locally):**

   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Start the React development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app should now be running locally. `By default`:

- The frontend runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- The backend runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| **Method** | **Endpoint**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST       | `/api/auth/signup`          | Registers a new user by saving their email and hashed password to the MongoDB database. After that a JWT token is returned and stored in an HTTP-only secured cookie, automatically logging the user in. |
| POST       | `/api/auth/login`           | Authenticates the user with their provided credentials (email and password). If successful, a JWT token is returned and stored in an HTTP-only secured cookie, providing access to protected resources.  |
| POST       | `/api/auth/logout`          | Logs out the user by setting the JWT token stored in the HTTP-only cookie as null and setting its expiration now, effectively invalidating the user's token cookie.                                      |
| GET        | `/api/users/me`             | Retrieves the current user's information (email, first name, last name) based on the authenticated session. This request requires the user to be logged in.                                              |
| PUT        | `/api/users/me`             | Allows the logged-in user to update their personal details, such as first name, last name, while keeping the rest of their account intact.                                                               |
| PUT        | `/api/auth/change-password` | Enables the user to change their password. The request requires both the old password (for verification) and the new password, updating the password in the database after successful verification.      |
| POST       | `/api/entries`              | Adds a new entry to the database. The request body must include the necessary details for the entry (date, title, mood, content). Only authenticated users can add entries.                              |
| GET        | `/api/entries`              | Retrieves all entries stored in the database. This is typically used by the user to view a list of all their entries. Requires the user to be authenticated.                                             |
| GET        | `/api/entries/:id`          | Retrieves a specific entry based on its unique ID. The ID should be passed as a parameter in the URL, and only the entry corresponding to that ID will be returned.                                      |
| PATCH      | `/api/entries/:id`          | Updates an existing entry specified by its ID. The request body must include the fields that need to be updated (date, title, mood, content). Only the owner of the entry can modify and see it.         |
| DELETE     | `/api/entries/:id`          | Deletes the entry specified by its ID. Only the user who created the entry is authorized to delete or see it. The entry will be permanently removed from the database.                                   |
| GET        | `/api/entries/search?text=` | Searches for entries that match the given search text in either the title or the description. The search query parameter text should contain the keyword(s) you want to search for.                      |
